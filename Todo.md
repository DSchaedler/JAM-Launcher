# Todo
- Load items from storage, rather than being generated when added.

  This will allow existing items to be loaded on startup (which is kind a big deal)
- Integrate CMPDL to download curseforge profiles

  Handle finding pack images to display on cards
- Handle finding and installing a forge version
- Handle attaching profiles to the minecraft Launcher
