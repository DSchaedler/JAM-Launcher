# JAM-Launcher
## Just Another Modpack Launcher

Here We Go!

JAM-Launcher is an attempt to make a launcher to handle Minecraft modpacks (including curse) without going through twitch/curse's launcher.

### Project Information
This is being built in Electron for Cross-Platform Support

### Wants List

- Will be implementing Vazkii's CMPDL script to download the packs.
- Also want to see if vazkii's script can handle installing custom modpacks from twitch
- Want to be able to import .zip packs
- Want to be able to create custom modpacks
- Want to offer pack updates when available

### Known Issues
- Menu Windows should not have a menu bar. This seems to be a bug in Electron.
